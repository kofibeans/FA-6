Provide an  R code on the geometric distribution. The geometric distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of trials required to achieve the first success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a constant probability of success.
1. Set the probability of success to p = 0.2
2. Generate 1000 random variables from the geometric distribution.
3. Calculate some basic statistics:
   [a] mean_x <- mean(x),
   [b] var_x <- var(x), and
   [c] sd_x <- sd(x).
4. Print the results for mean, variance, and standard deviation.
5. Plot the histogram of the results.
